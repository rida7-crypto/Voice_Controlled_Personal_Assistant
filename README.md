A Jarvis‑style desktop assistant built with Python. It enables voice‑activated commands to open local applications, browse websites, and interact with the system using natural speech input.  

## Features  
- 🎙️ **Voice Recognition**: Uses `speech_recognition` for capturing and processing commands.  
- 🗣️ **Text‑to‑Speech (TTS)**: Offline speech output with `pyttsx3`.  
- 🖥️ **GUI Interface**: Built with `tkinter` for voice selection and emotional modulation.  
- ⚡ **Desktop & Web Control**: Launch local apps and navigate to websites via voice.  
- 🔧 **Customizable**: Extendable for new commands and personalized workflows.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, `tkinter`

## Future Enhancements
- Add more advanced NLP for complex queries.  
- Integrate with productivity tools (calendar, reminders).  
- Expand emotional modulation for richer user interaction.
